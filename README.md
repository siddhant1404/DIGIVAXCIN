# Covid-19-Patient-Diary

This is a Streamlit App that allows Covid-19 patients to track their symptom history. 
By doing so, they can see their risk factor, which is calculated by the data collected from other Covid-19 patients over a 14 day period.
For each day, we guide the user and compare their risk factor to the other patients, which shows them whether they are on track to recovery or have more serious symtoms than the average patient.
We also provide functionality to see the covid-19 patients on a map, and locate any clusters to spot any potential hotspots.
